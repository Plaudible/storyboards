# osu! Storyboards by Plaudible

These are storyboards I created using the Storybrew editor developed by Damnae. (https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew/releases/tag/1.67) These are all coded in C#. Please see my osu! profile and submitted maps to visualize, or put these into Storybrew for reference. All of my scripts used are provided within each mapset's folder.

NOTE: Some scripts are hardcoded on a map-by-map basis. If you have any suggestions or need help implementing these feel free to reach out.
