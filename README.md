# osu! Storyboards by Plaudible

These are storyboards I created using the Storybrew editor developed by Damnae. (https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew/releases/tag/1.67) These are all coded in C#. Please see my osu! profile and submitted maps to visualize, or put these into Storybrew for reference. All of my scripts used are provided within each mapset's folder.

# What are osu! Storyboards?

osu! storyboards are a means of telling a story via background animations to a song to accompany the beatmap. This can be anything from lyrics, spectrums, panning/tilting/zooming, particle effects, or much more complex designs.
