00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,230
The alchemist escaped, fleeing her own retribution...

2
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,560
...But she could not outrun the weight of her sins - a curse, placed on her soul.

3
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:21,231
We have such history, you and I...

4
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:56,565
Allow me to introduce myself...

5
00:06:56,565 --> 00:07:02,565
I am Count Vladislaus, Dracula!

6
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:42,398
The alchemist bargained, seeking out the one who could lift her curse.

7
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:47,731
Count Vladislaus described only one who could - his daughter.

8
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:53,065
But, he informed her of her regrettable fate...

9
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:58,898
Should she attempt to lift the curse, she would surely perish.
