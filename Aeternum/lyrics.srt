1
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,460
Bow your head before your king

2
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,660
As I'm the bringer of light

3
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,260
The chosen one amongst all men

4
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,860
The lord and master of light

5
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,460
But who decided it all?

6
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,660
Shut up you servant

7
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,060
Respect divine right

8
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,660
For I belong to the elite of mankind

9
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,460
Enlightened guardian of justice and right

10
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,860
My word is law or it's eye for an eye

11
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,460
Bow down before the sovereign of the kingdom

12
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,860
I will lead you through the hardest times

13
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,260
Devote we are to the crown

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,860
In sole command forever glorious

15
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,660
Hail

16
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,260
Long live the great king!

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,460
Long live the great king!

18
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,460
Born with the fire inside

19
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,860
The flame of wisdom burns in my noble heart

20
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,860
Turns into guiding light

21
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,860
that blows the mist on the path

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,460
"We'll follow you 'till the end!"

23
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,460
Balance of power, the art of the wise

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Ancestral pride to preserve for my bloodline

25
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,860
Resounds my name through spirals of time

26
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,260
Until kingdom come I

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,660
God

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,860
Bless my soul

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,530
Guide my fury through this cold war

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,860
Hunting Judas down

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,390
Now free my hands

32
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:28,330
From the spires of the serpent

33
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,060
Death to the traitors of the crown

34
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,130
No one to trust and no one to save

35
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,320
As this court is a den of snakes

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,530
Walk alone through this treacherous world

37
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,730
Mutilating the venomous tongue

38
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,930
Your misleading words

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,530
Hide desire to prevail

40
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,330
In this devious show

41
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,720
Fail

42
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,930
No one is virtuous

43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,530
No one is grown

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,730
No one deserves to be heir to the throne

45
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,930
'Till their veins will be filled with their gall

46
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,520
I will stand for the sake of the sacred crown

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,720
Forever at war

48
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,330
You deceiving worms

49
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,930
Will be smashed by my rage

50
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,730
In the name of God

51
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,530
SLAYED!

52
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,330
In aeternam

53
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,530
Draining struggle to serve my reign

54
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,130
With full force restore the integrity

55
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,330
Purify consciences through blood

56
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,330
Extirpate those cancers, dictate my law

57
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,130
'Till the day of my fall

58
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,530
Beware, you'll pay for your faults

59
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,120
God

60
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,330
Bless my soul

61
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:48,330
Guide my fury through this cold war

62
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,930
God

63
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,130
Bless my soul

64
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,800
Guide my fury through this cold war

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,270
Hunting Judas down

66
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,930
Now free my hands

67
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,600
From the spires of the serpent

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,530
Death to the traitors of the crown
